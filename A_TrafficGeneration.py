This code generates bursty traffic (including bith uniform and bursty traffic)
of a massive machine type communication (mMTC) network based on given MTC
groups and the probability of happening a burst in each group.

The generated traffic patterns will be stored in "Traffic" folder as PyTorch
tensors.
